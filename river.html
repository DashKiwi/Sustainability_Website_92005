                <h2>How do you clean it?</h2>
                <p>The Ocean Cleanup cleans the river by wrapping a massive net between
                    the sides of the river. The net brings all of the rubbish into the rubbish
                    collectors where it is then put into massive bins. When the bin
                    gets full it sends a notification to one of the employes which 
                    comes out and replaces it so it can continue cleaning the ocean!

                <h2>Where are they cleaning?</h2>
                <p>The ocean cleanup is trying to stop as much plastic from all the rivers
                    that they can but unfortunately that is expensive and hard to setup.
                    Currently though they have set up some machines in these countries
                    Indonesia, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, USA, and Thailand.
                    They are looking to expand to more rivers hopefully soon!

                <h2>How expensive is it?</h2>
                <p>The Ocean Cleanup is very expensive because it involves creating and
                    maintaining advanced machines to remove plastic from the ocean. These
                    costs include designing, building, and operating the cleanup systems,
                    as well as paying for research and staff. Funding comes from 
                    donations, companies, and grants, but it's a big investment because
                    cleaning the ocean is a huge and important job.
